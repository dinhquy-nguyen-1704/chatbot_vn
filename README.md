## 1. Introduction
This repository is designed to help you get started with building and fine-tuning your own AI chatbot in Vietnamese. The default model used in this repository is [vinallama-7b-chat](https://huggingface.co/vilm/vinallama-7b-chat) and the default dataset is [chatbot_instruction_prompts](https://huggingface.co/datasets/alespalla/chatbot_instruction_prompts).

## 2. Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/dinhquy-nguyen-1704/chatbot_vn.git
```
```
cd chatbot_vn
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Training
First, log in to Hugging Face and create a New Token with **write** mode.
```
python -c "from huggingface_hub.hf_api import HfFolder; HfFolder.save_token('your_token')"
```
To train the model, run the following command:
```
python main.py
```
> You can also adjust the following parameters for the training process: 
```
--model: name of the trained model file
--dataset: dataset used for fine-tuning
--output_dir: name of the model on HuggingFace after training
--max_new_tokens: maximum number of new tokens that can be generated in the output
--temperature: controls the randomness of the outputâ€™s predictions
--top_p: known as nucleus sampling, this parameter decides the number of words to consider for each prediction
--num_return_sequences: specifies the number of sequences to generate
```

## 4. Inference
To use the trained model, run the following command:
```
python infer.py --model_hf_name model_name --text your_text
```
> Where:
```
model_name: name of the trained model on HuggingFace
your_text: your question for model
```
